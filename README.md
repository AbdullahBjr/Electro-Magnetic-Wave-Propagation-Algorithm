# Electro-Magnetic-Wave-Propagation-Algorithm
The Electro-Magnetic Wave Propagation Algorithm (EMWPA) is a population-based metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the propagation behavior of electromagnetic waves. EMWPA is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and suitable for solving continuous optimization problems and engineering design applications.
