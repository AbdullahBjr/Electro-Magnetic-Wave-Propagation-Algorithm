
Before implementing the EMWPA source code in MATLAB, please carefully read the instructions given below.

As an initial step, it is strongly recommended to read the original EMWPA algorithm and understand the underlying mathematical model before examining the code implementation.

 Main paper:  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asej.2025.103615  

Study the MATLAB source code step by step with the help of the provided comments to clearly understand the role of each function and parameter.

Before executing the main EMWPA file, make sure that all dependent files (benchmark functions and plotting utilities) are placed in the same working directory or added to the MATLAB path.

Run the main file to execute the EMWPA algorithm and visualize the convergence behavior and optimization results.
